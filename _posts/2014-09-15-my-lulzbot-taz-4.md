After 4 years of wanting one I finally broke down and bought a 3d printer for myself. I spent nearly 6 months researching them and considered many options. I considered
buying a kit or an inexpensive one but when it came down to it I wanted something of quality that I could modify if I wanted to but would be a work horse out of the gate.

After nearly 1 week with it I am quite pleased. I'm still fine tuning it especially with ABS but the enclosure that is being built for it will hopefully fix the little separation
issue I'm having.
